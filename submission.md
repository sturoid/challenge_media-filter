# Submission Notes

## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

More tests. Mainly on the individual UI components. If I was working on a bigger project I also would have modularized the styling a little more so they could be reused. Lastly I would probably change the filter to use one "update" method and then one reset back to the initial values instead of doing each one individually like I am now. I'm fairly happy with the file and folder structure but that can always be improved. 

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

I don't think I did that I can remember. 

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

I had fun doing it and thank you for the opportunity :).
